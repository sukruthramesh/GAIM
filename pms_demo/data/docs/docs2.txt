Nomura has set its price target for the Nifty for 2026 at 29,300, implying an upside of close to 13% from the index's Tuesday closing level. ICICI Bank, Infosys, Bajaj Finance, Mahindra & Mahindra, Axis Bank, Titan, Ultratech Cement, Godrej Consumer Products, LG Electronics, CG Power, Swiggy, Dr Reddy's, Dixon Technologies, Alkem, Mahindra Finance, Sona Comstar, eClerx, Aditya Birla Real Estate and MedPlus are its top picks.
"A positive view on valuation is now underpinned by calmer geopolitics, stable macros, and a cyclical recovery in economic and corporate earnings growth," said Nomura in a client note. "Furthermore, the Indian equity markets have underperformed most global markets over the past 14 months, and thus the valuation premium is now aligned to historical averages."
